# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Project

It is a project related to a classification of companies’ landing pages into 19 industry sectors based on their html contents. The repository contains 3 notebooks that correspond to three different models, which are highlighted in the following.

• Logistic Regression model: It is the baseline model, in which a gradio application is included in this notebook. In the online application, one needs to enter the text in order to get the industry class of the company of interest. In fact, one can enter a html content of a firm's website and then the output of gradio application is a forecast of its industry class, or one can simply copy some texts from the website of a firm and then the online application will predict its industry class. Some examples of texts taken from companies' websites are attached in this application.

• Support Vector Machine (SVM) model: This model is associated with some inference applications in which the industry sectors of two companies are being predicted at the end of this notebook using as inputs their html contents.

• BERT model: it corresponds to the deep learning model.
